TatraDAS disassembler 
     changelog

+ <=> addition
- <=> removal
~ <=> change 
! <=> bug fix


[2.9.9 - 1. august 2009]
+ open file by drag & drop
+ SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2 instructions
+ more options in console versions (save as project, DAS, NASM, etc.)
+ "Go to line" function
+ message dialog buttons are now translatable 
+ calls of imported functions are now detected one level higher (call x, x: jump [0x...])
~ Save function divided to Save Project and Export (Disassembly, NASM, Custom)
~ optimized speed Exported functions displaying (noticable in case of 2000 or more functions)   
~ disassembly lines replacing algorithm (used during each modification of disassembly text after initial disassembling)
~ close all code sections before redisassembling (improves speed of "Preparing output" phase)   
~ size of memory operand is now always displayed (=> files created by NASM export are now compilable by NASM :) )
! Cancel behavior after in Choose file dialog during saving project  
! hexedit - crash when caret moved to the last three bytes
! operand size of some FPU instructions, FLD (only one operand, Inter manual bug), FUCOM similarly
! Advanced changing to data - Bytes count 
! crash - Advanced changing to data - Code begins 
! Advanced disassemble - Max address  - works now
! FPU instructions' operand size does not depend on operand-size attribute
! XLATB instruction was XLAT/XLATB  
! "undefined opcode" lines had address relative to code section beginning
! some SSE(x) were missing third operand
! NASM export - comments were exported incorrectly
! correct distinguishing of MOVLPS/MOVHLPS, MOVHPS/MOVLHPS instructions (same opcode, different reg/mem addressing)
! MOVD instruction with MMX register operand was 32 bit register
! 0xDFE0 should be FNSTSW AX, not FSTSW AX (this was caused by bug in Intel manual (opcode map)), similarly FSTCW/FNSTCW, FSTSW/FNSTSW word [], FSTENV/FNSTENV, FSAVE/FNSAVE, FINIT/FNINIT, FCLEX/FNCLEX 
! CALL far mem - "far" was missing (so it behaved like "near")
! memory leaks fixed thanks to FastMM4 memory manager
! freeze in case of change to Pascal string which excedds code section (now does nothing)
! FXRSTOR was called FXSTOR (missing 'R') => not highlighted
! instructons LDMXCSR, STMXCSR, FXSAVE, FXRSTOR, CLFLUSH did not have operand
! crash of NASM export if disassembly constains "qword" or Pascal string

[2.9.8 - 27. December 2007]
+ imported functions in NE files 
+ sorting of columns in Import and Export 
+ highlighting of active line in disassembly view
~ memory addresses in code sections instead of code section relative adresses
~ heavy optimization - running time cut by 60%
~ new icon set, thank you Maros 
~ almost evething was refactorized, many parts rewritten 
! lot of bugs discovered and fixed
- instruction count option from Advanced disassemble dialog

[2.9.7 - 23. December 2004] 
+ "Follow Jump/Call" enabled in case of jump/call/loop references
+ UNICODE strings
+ some new icons
! "End of section", "Code begins" data change
! floating point data change (single & double NAN)
! stability in case of "Stop"
! size of operands for FPU $DD opcodes FLD, FST and FSTP
! some instructions (opcode, prefix etc.)
 

[2.9.6 - 31. May 2004]
+ imported and exported functions in NE file format
+ hexeditor improved ("Go to address", display data on caret position, translation)
+ SYSCALL and SYSRET instructions (AMD)
+ Goto Bookmarks' shortcuts in main menu (Alt + XX)
+ all messages can be translated
+ more hints on menu items
+ shortcuts on bookmarks (Alt + XY) in menu
+ Advanced Disassemble function (Instruction Count and (Non)Recursive not implemented yet) 
! handling of undefined one byte and 3DNow! opcodes 
! handling of invalid exported functions (RVA not in any of code sections - cygwin1.dll)
! handling of code sections with MemorySize > FileSize

[2.9.5 - 2. April 2004]
+ basic ELF(Linux & comp.) file format support
+ it's now possible to use your own localization files (translations of TatraDAS)
+ bookmarks
! handling of undefined One byte Group and FPU opcodes 

[2.9.4 - 2. March 2004]
~ license changed to GNU GPL
